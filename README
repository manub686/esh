0. Setup

set paths in .bashrc:
export ESH_DIR=~/workspace/esh
export PATH=$PATH:$ESH_DIR

1. Run the esh daemon:

$ eshd

Wait for the process to set up a debug connection to the board, then move it to
background if you want.

2. Use esh to interact with the board:

$ esh  #lists available esh commands

Typical usage:

$ esh evminit
$ esh loadall
$ esh runall
$ esh evmshutdown
$ esh bye
